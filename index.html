                    Ensure all revenues and expenses are reported during the period in which 
                    they are earned and incurred. They help to ensure that asset accounts reflect what the 
                    company actually owns or has legal rights to. Liability accounts reflect the obligations of the company at the end of the period.
                    After adjustments have been made financial statements should present a clear picture of whether or not the business was profitable in the current year, as well as what economic resources the company owns, and owes, at the end of that period.
                    They give a complete picture of the companies performance that is not misleading.
